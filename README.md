# Directed Generative Net (VAE) Project

Welcome to the **Directed Generative Net (VAE) Project**, a futuristic implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on the MNIST dataset. This project features a cyberpunk-inspired web interface where users can generate MNIST-like digits, interpolate between latent representations, and download results—all wrapped in a sleek, dark-themed design with neon green accents.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based VAE model implemented with PyTorch, trained to generate handwritten digit images. The project includes a Flask web server with an interactive, futuristic interface powered by Tailwind CSS and particles.js. Key features include random seed generation, latent space interpolation, and ZIP file downloads.

## Features

- **VAE Model**: Trains on MNIST to generate 28x28 grayscale digit images.
- **Futuristic Web Interface**: Dark-themed with neon green glows, glitch animations, and particle effects.
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust the number of samples (1–20) and set a random seed for reproducibility.
- **Latent Interpolation**: Preview and generate images by interpolating between two latent vectors.
- **Download Option**: Export all generated images as a ZIP file.
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the generated image folder.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required Python packages:
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`
  - `flask`
  - `pillow`
  - `numpy`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DIRECTED_GEN_NET_PROJECT.git
   cd DIRECTED_GEN_NET_PROJECT
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision flask pillow numpy
   ```

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the training script to generate the `vae_model.pth` file:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```
   - This may take 5–10 minutes depending on your hardware (faster with GPU).

5. **Create the Generated Folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p static/generated
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Web Server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Interface**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
   - Use the slider to select the number of samples (1–20).
   - Optionally, enter a seed number for reproducible results.
   - Click "Generate Samples" to create images.

3. **Explore Features**:
   - **Interpolation**: Enter seeds for points A and B, adjust the interpolation factor (0–1), and see a live preview.
   - **Download**: Click "Download ZIP" to save all generated images.
   - **Clear**: Click "Clear Images" to reset the gallery.
